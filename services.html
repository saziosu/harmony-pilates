        <h2>Our Services</h2>
        <p>
            At Harmony Pilates we offer both Mat and Reformer sessions.
            <br>There are advantages to both options. Depending
            on your individual experience levels or requirements you may want to choose one or the other, or a mix of
            both!

                <h3>Mat</h3>
                <p>Mat pilates, as the name implies, involves the floor and a mat in its purest form. In this form of
                    pilates, your own bodyweight is the main resistance. It is ideal for those that are recovering from
                    a neck or shoulder injury or may have some other requirements making working on a reformer
                    unsuitable. Mat work is also a fantastic option for newcomers to pilates as it teaches the
                    fundamentals of feeling and controlling your muscles without the resistance and support offered by
                    the reformer machine. Many also find Mat pilates more difficult, contrary to popular belief! This is
                    because you are using your body all the time without the support and resistance offered by the
                    reformer machine!</p>

                <h3>Reformer</h3>
                <p>The reformer machine is made up of a flat padded bed, with a sliding carriage with straps and
                    pulleys. The level of resistance is increased and decreased by changing the levels of springs on the
                    machine.
                    Increasing the resistance increases the load placed on the muscle, so it is greatly versatile in the
                    level of work the muscles need to do to complete the movement. This allows it to be suitable for
                    both advanced users and new beginners. The reformer machine is also a wonderful option for those
                    recovering from an injury as it provides support to the body and allows muscles to be worked in a
                    horizontal position without having to bear weight in the vertical plane.</p>
